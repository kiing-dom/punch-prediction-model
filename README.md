# Punch Prediction Model

## Project Overview
- The Punch Prediction Model is a computer vision-based project aimed at analyzing a boxer's stance and movements to predict the most likely punches they will throw next. By processing video inputs and using advanced deep learning techniques, the system will identify patterns in a boxer's movements to forecast specific boxing moves. 

- The base model is complete (still very innacurate but that's just because of the training data)
